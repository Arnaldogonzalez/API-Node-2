GRAPHQL vs REST

GRAPHQL
- One route
- Not based on HTTP verbs
- Strict data typing
- Interactive docs
- Works well with a component architecture
- Advanced data resolving

REST
- Many routes
- Based on HTTP verbs
- Cacheable on a network level

FINAL NODE.JS PROJECT
- You should have a dataset to work with (recommend the mongodb datasets)
- REST API using express, mongoose
- You need to implement the front-end
